Hi there! I'm Ivan Marin, a physicist that turned into a data scientist, working as a manager of data science projects. I've been talking with customers to understand their problems and translate into projects that deliver real results using data, including problem definition, requirements, architecture design and applied data engineering for machine learning systems and data products. As a manager, I'm always curious about learning methods that work well for data science teams and how to collaborate with other specialties and disciplines.

This is my personal blog, where I put things that are interesting to me, like Machine Learning, Data and Software Engineering and sometimes other stuff.
