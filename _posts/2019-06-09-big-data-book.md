I wrote a book! [Big Data Analysis with Python](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/big-data-analysis-python) just came out by Packt. It was an interesting process, and different from my experience when I was writing my [dissertation](http://www.teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/76/76132/tde-21082008-111614/pt-br.php) and my [thesis](http://www.teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/18/18138/tde-04052012-103418/pt-br.php), as it was way more focused, quick-paced and with a better vision of the final product. The folks at Packt where helpful, even if the process was not completely smooth.

The book itself is about how to use Python for analysis of large datasets, including visualization and business understanding. It encompass the use of Pandas, Hadoop and Spark to go from data to a final, full report. Go take a look and please let me know what you think, or if there are any mistakes!
